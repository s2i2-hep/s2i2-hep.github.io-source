A joint [Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG)](http://wlcg.web.cern.ch/) and [HEP Software Foundation (HSF)](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) workshop will be held on 26-29 March, 2018, in Naples, Italy. The workshop looks forward to the common challenges faced in HEP Software and Computing in the next decade, when the [High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC)](https://home.cern/topics/high-luminosity-lhc) at [CERN](https://home.cern/) will start and the [Long Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF)](https://lbnf.fnal.gov/) at [Fermilab](http://fnal.gov/) will become operational. Major programmes of work in software and computing have been identified as a result of the HSF's [Community White Paper](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/activities/cwp.html) process, which published its [Roadmap](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06982) in December 2017 and now is the time to start implementing them.

In the workshop we will look to identify prototypes that will clarify the best and most promising lines of work for the next few years. There will be many plenary sessions, to engage the whole community in discussion of the challenges ahead and to find common projects as much as we can. Parallel sessions will allow working groups to make real progress on their goals.

Dates: 26-29 March, 2018
