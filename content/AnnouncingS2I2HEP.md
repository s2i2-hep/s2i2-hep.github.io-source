We are happy to announce that the S2I2/HEP conceputalization project 
has been funded by the National Science Foundation's [Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation](http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504817) (SI2) program. We are just kicking off the project, and will be updating these web pages and adding posts as we go along. 

General news will be posted to this website's blog, but we've also created a 
[S2I2-HEP Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/s2i2-hep).
If you are interested in following the S2I2-HEP conceptualization process,
please subscribe to that mailing list.
