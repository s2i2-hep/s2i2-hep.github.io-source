Summary: Summary of the S2I2/HEP Conceptualization Project
Template: homepage

Advanced software plays a fundamental role for large scientific
projects - from designing experimental instruments to acquiring,
reducing, and analyzing the resulting data. In such projects, success
requires large-scale collaboration; software is the glue that enables
teams of researchers to work together to exploit accelerators,
telescopes and other large scientific instruments. Building the
requisite software is technically challenging because computing
technologies (processors, storage, networks) are evolving rapidly
and data volumes are increasing rapidly.

The primary goal of the S2I2/HEP conceptualization project is to
prepare a strategic plan for a potential Scientific Software
Innovation Institute (S2I2) to develop software for experiments
taking data in the "High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider" (HL-LHC)
era. Along the way, we will produce a big-picture model for developing
software and computing models for use at the HL-LHC and, more
generally, for the high energy physics (HEP) community.


As part of the NSF's [Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation
(SI2)](http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504817)
program, the S2I2-HEP conceptualization project is concerned with the 
overarching goal of transforming innovations in research and education into 
sustained software resources that are an integral part of the 
cyberinfrastructure.
