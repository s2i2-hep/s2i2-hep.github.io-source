Summary: Summary of the S2I2-HEP Conceptualization Project
Template: homepage

Advanced software plays a fundamental role for large scientific
projects - from designing experimental instruments to acquiring,
reducing, and analyzing the resulting data. 
<!--- In such projects, success
requires large-scale collaboration; software is the glue that enables
teams of researchers to work together to exploit accelerators,
telescopes and other large scientific instruments. Building the
requisite software is technically challenging because computing
technologies (processors, storage, networks) are evolving rapidly
and data volumes are increasing rapidly. --->

The primary goal of the S2I2-HEP conceptualization project is to
prepare a strategic plan for a potential NSF Scientific Software
Innovation Institute (S2I2) to develop software for experiments
taking data in the "High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider" (HL-LHC)
era in the 2020s. In addition, we are working with the [HEP Software
Foundation](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org) to prepare
a larger HEP 
[Community White Paper (CWP)](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/cwp.html) 
describing a global roadmap for HEP Software and Computing R&D for the 2020s. 
Building a US and global community to accomplish this R&D roadmap is an
essential element. To achieve these goals we are organizing a number of workshops during 2017.

**Update 20 Mar 2019** - The Community White Paper has now been published as ["A Roadmap for HEP Software and Computing R&D for the 2020s"](https://doi.org/10.1007/s41781-018-0018-8) in the journal ["Computing and Software for Big Science"](https://link.springer.com/journal/41781).

**Update 4 Sep 2018** - The NSF today [launched](https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=296456) the "Institute for Research and Innovation in 
Software in High Energy Physics (IRIS-HEP)". IRIS-HEP will implement the strategic plan developed by the S2I2-HEP project. More information can be found on the [IRIS-HEP website](http://iris-hep.org).

**Update 18 Dec 2017** - The S2I2-HEP Strategic Plan and Community White Paper documents are now available:

  * Strategic Plan for a Scientific Software Innovation Institute (S2I2) for
   High Energy Physics - [arXiv 1712.06592](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06592)
  * A Roadmap for HEP Software and Computing R&D for the 2020s (Community White Paper) - [arXiv 1712.06982](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06982)
