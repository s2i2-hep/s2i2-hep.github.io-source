Summary: Summary of the S2I2-HEP Conceptualization Project
Template: homepage

Advanced software plays a fundamental role for large scientific
projects - from designing experimental instruments to acquiring,
reducing, and analyzing the resulting data. 
<!--- In such projects, success
requires large-scale collaboration; software is the glue that enables
teams of researchers to work together to exploit accelerators,
telescopes and other large scientific instruments. Building the
requisite software is technically challenging because computing
technologies (processors, storage, networks) are evolving rapidly
and data volumes are increasing rapidly. --->

The primary goal of the S2I2-HEP conceptualization project is to
prepare a strategic plan for a potential NSF Scientific Software
Innovation Institute (S2I2) to develop software for experiments
taking data in the "High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider" (HL-LHC)
era in the 2020s. 
To prepare the strategic plan for an NSF S2I2, as well as a larger HEP 
community white paper on software and computing, 
we are organizing a number of workshops
between Fall 2016 and Summer 2017
in collaboration with the [HEP Software
Foundation](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org). More information about
these workshops, and the related planning, will be forthcoming by September
2016 on this webpage and via our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/s2i2-hep). 

*Upcoming Events:*

  * S2I2 HEP/CS Workshop (7-9 Dec, 2016, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) - [Event page](http://hep.physics.illinois.edu/hepg/S2I2-HEP-CS-WKSHP/home.html), [Indico page](https://indico.cern.ch/event/575443/)
  * HEP Software Foundation Workshop (23-26 Jan, 2017) - [Indico page](http://indico.cern.ch/event/570249/)

The S2I2-HEP conceptualization project is part of the NSF's [Software 
Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation
(SI2)](http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504817)
program.
