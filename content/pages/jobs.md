### NYU

An opening for a full-time Postdoctoral Researcher has arisen in association to the DIANA/HEP project. The primary goal of DIANA/HEP is to develop state-of-the-art tools for experiments which acquire, reduce, and analyze petabytes of data. Improving performance, interoperability, and collaborative tools through modifications and additions to ROOT and other packages broadly used by the community will allow users to more fully exploit the data being acquired at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and other facilities. 

This position would report to Prof. Kyle Cranmer with the [experimental particle physics group at New York University](http://physics.nyu.edu/experimentalparticle/) and may receive the honorary title of “Research Engineer” through the [Moore-Sloan Data Science Environment at NYU](http://cds.nyu.edu/mooresloan/). The focus of this position is on improving interoperability with the scientific python ecosystem and development of collaborative tools. The successful candidate will also be able to devote a significant fraction of their time to their own research program within the ATLAS experiment. We seek applicants both from a traditional HEP background with a strong software focus as well as applicants from the machine learning and data science communities that are interested in HEP research topics.
   
The position can  be based either at NYU or at CERN.  The postdoc can benefit from the lively atmosphere of the [Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics (CCPP)](http://cosmo.nyu.edu/) as well as the 
[Moore-Sloan Data Science Environment at NYU](http://cds.nyu.edu/mooresloan/) . Further information on the experimental particle physics group at NYU may be found at [http://physics.nyu.edu/experimentalparticle/](http://physics.nyu.edu/experimentalparticle/)

Applications must be submitted via the CCPP Online Application System (please select “DIANA” in your research interests). Complete applications must include a CV, publication list, statement of research interests, and a list of three people who will be submitting letters of recommendation. The position is available immediately and applications will be considered until the position is filled.
