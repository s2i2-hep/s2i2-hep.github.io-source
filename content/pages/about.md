Summary: Summary of the S2I2-HEP Conceptualization Project


Advanced software plays a fundamental role for large scientific projects - from designing experimental instruments to acquiring, reducing, and analyzing the resulting data. In such projects, success requires large-scale collaboration; software is the glue that enables teams
of researchers to work together to exploit accelerators, telescopes and other large scientific instruments. Building the requisite software is technically challenging because computing technologies (processors, storage, networks) are evolving rapidly and data volumes are increasing rapidly. The primary goal of the proposed research is to prepare a strategic plan for a potential Scientific Software Innovation Institute (S2I2) to develop software for experiments taking
data in the "High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider" (HL-LHC) era. Along the way, we will produce a big-picture model for developing software and computing models for use at the HL-LHC and, more generally, for the high energy physics (HEP) community.

As part of the NSF's [Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation (SI2)](http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504817) program, S2I2-HEP is concerned with the overarching goal of transforming innovations in research and education into sustained software resources that are an integral part of the cyberinfrastructure.
