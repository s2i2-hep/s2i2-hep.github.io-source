### Project Overview

Advanced software plays a fundamental role in large 
scientific projects. The primary goal of DIANA/HEP (Data Intensive ANAlysis
for High Energy Physics) is to develop state-of-the-art tools for
experiments which acquire, reduce, and analyze petabytes of data.
Improving performance, interoperability, and collaborative tools
through modifications and additions to packages broadly used by the
community will allow users to more fully exploit the data being
acquired at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and other facilities.
These experiments are addressing questions at the heart of physics
-- what are the underlying constituents of matter and how do they
interact? With the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, the Standard
Model of particle physics is complete. It provides an excellent
description of known particles and forces. However, the most
interesting questions remain open, for example: What is the dark matter 
which pervades the universe? Does space-time have additional symmetries
or extend beyond the 3 spatial dimensions we know? What is the
mechanism stabilizing the Higgs boson mass from enormous quantum
corrections? 


The next generation of experiments will collect exabyte-scale data samples 
to provide answers to these and many other questions. Analyzing this data will 
require new and better tools. DIANA will provide the CPU and IO performance needed to reduce
the iteration time so crucial to explore new ideas. We will develop
software to effectively exploit emerging many- and multi-core
hardware. We will establish infrastructure for a higher-level of
collaborative analysis, building on the successful patterns used
for the Higgs boson discovery and enabling a deeper communication
between the theoretical community and the experimental community.
DIANA's products will sit in the ROOT framework, already used by
our community of more than 10,000 particle and nuclear physicists.
By improving interoperability with the larger scientific software
ecosystem, DIANA will also incorporate best practices and algorithms
from other disciplines into HEP.  We will provide training for students
in these techniques.
Similarly, we will make our computing
insights, tools, and novel ideas related to collaborative analysis,
standards for data preservation, and best practices for treating
software as a research product available to the larger scientific
community.
