Today the Management Board of the [Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG)](http://wlcg.web.cern.ch/) approved a [charge](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/assets/CWP-Charge-HSF.pdf) for the [HEP Software Foundation (HSF)](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) and the LHC experiments ([Alice](http://aliceinfo.cern.ch/Public/Welcome.html), [Atlas](http://atlas.cern/), [CMS](http://cms.web.cern.ch/), [LHCb](http://lhcb.web.cern.ch/lhcb/)) to proceed with preparing a [Community White Paper" (CWP)](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/assets/CWP-Charge-HSF.pdf) with a roadmap for Software and Computing Research and Development to prepare for the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) in the 2020s.

The HL-LHC project anticipates significant upgrades to both the
accelerator and large detectors which will extend the LHC physics
programme through the 2030s. Realizing the full physics potential
of these investments requires commensurate attention also to software,
which is ubiquitous in the process by which data is acquired,
managed, processed and analyzed to produce physics results from the 
LHC experiments.
