The National Science Foundation has [announced](http://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=189347&WT.mc_id=USNSF_51&WT.mc_ev=click) the first two S2I2 Software Institutes: the [Science Gateways Community Institute](http://sciencegateways.org/) and the [Molecular Sciences Software Institute](http://molssi.org/), representing a total investment of $35M by the NSF.

 These S2I2 awards are the first large-scale institutes funded by the [Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation (SI2)](http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504817) program. The NSF has also awarded $500k to [Princeton University](http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1558216&HistoricalAwards=false), the [University of Cincinnati](http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1558219&HistoricalAwards=false), and the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1558233&HistoricalAwards=false) to fund the conceptualization of a software institute to accelerate research enabled by the High-Luminosity Upgrade at the Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC. The [S2I2-HEP](http://s2i2-hep.org/) conceptualization project will be an important step towards realizing the scientific potential of the HL-LHC. This project is aligned with the [National Strategic Computing Initiative (NSCI)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/07/29/executive-order-creating-national-strategic-computing-initiative).
